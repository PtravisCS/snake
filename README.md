## The Classic Snake Game ##

A work in progress, I wanted to try my hand ad creating the classic arcade game Snake in C.

Compiled using GCC for Linux requires ncurses.
`gcc -lncurses main.c`

Included binary is for a debian system running debian 10.

### TO DO ###

* ~~Add code to add pellets to random locations on the map.~~
* ~~Add code for snake to consume pellets and grow in length.~~
* Refactor code (badly needed), break everything out of main into individual functions.
