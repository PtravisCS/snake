/*
 * Title        : Snake
 * Purpose      : A C based clone of the game Snake originally hailing from the late 70's.
 *                The objective of the game is to control a line using the arrow keys, having
 *                the line pick up objects which cause it to grow longer. The player loses when
 *                they hit the edge of the play area or when they hit themselves.

 * Dependancies : This program reuires the Ncurses Library
